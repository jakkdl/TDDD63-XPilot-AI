Write a User Manual: Done!
    Probably not perfect so feel free to improve it /hatten

Write Technical overview (this is supposed to be written incrementally during the project, so we should start immediately)
    Magnus started


Ultimate goal: Move, shoot, dodge and avoid walls.
finalAI.py
    Move
        Done! Pathfinding would be sexy though.
    Shoot
        He aims like crap, it works, but should be improved
    Dodge
        Not implemented, magnus working on finishing the fourth
    avoid walls
        It rarely crashes into walls, but it does sometimes, fix that.
        It's pretty dumb l0l (improve in general)
        Would be sexy to check for walls all around us, or at least heading +/- 10 degrees.

    Additional features!
        Strategies?
        Make it handle multiple enemies



Map: final.xp
    RateOfFire
        Heavily changed.
    Shotspeed
        Upped to 21, maybe cool to heighten it further.
    Turnspeed
        untouched.
    Map layout
        Decent, Feel free to improve it
    Friction
        0.05, seem to work pretty well
    ship weight
        untouched

    More stuff?




I don't think the assistant care about these anymore, just make sure to finish the fourth, as that's needed for finalAI.py
