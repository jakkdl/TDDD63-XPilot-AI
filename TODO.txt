Add stuff you think needs to be done here, as well as make a comment if you're working on it. Also comment if you encounter problems or similar.


* Add stuff to this TODO!

uppgift4:
    Could use some tweaking, but fuck it for now.

uppgift 1-7: Approved.
However, I have completely rewritten the entire uppgift4 largely basing it on uppgift 6, thusly it is no longer, in current form, working as well as I would like, though it is better than the old version . I will have it working as intended shortly.

uppgift8: 
Near done.

We need to do 9-10, and we can skip 11. To quote mr. dude: "You can get 11 approved by just running two 9s".
The follow thingy on assignment 10 we can accomplish by just making a script to chase, but make sure it stops and avoids colliding if the leader ship stops.

After that we need the "real" assignments. He recommends us to do 1,2 and then 5. Then proceed with 3,4 if we have time.

Otherwise, rock on
