Download and install xpilot from http://sourceforge.net/projects/xpilotgame
Download and install xpilot-ai from http://xpilot-ai.org/

(if you fail to install any of these, look further down for instructions regarding xpilot-ng and xpilot-ng-ai)

Start a server with
$ xpilots

Useful flags are
    -map /path/to/map.xp Load another map than the default
    -noQuit             The server doesn't quit when it gets empty
    -maxIdleTime 0      The server doesn't kick inactive players, useful for testing.
    +reportToMetaServer This will avoid having other players and AI's from around the world join the game.
    -port <number>      Change default port to avoid conflicting with other servers on the same network
    -maxClientsPerIp <nr>   To increase the amount of clients that can connect from the same IP (default 2)
further options can be found with
$ man xpilots


The map(s) supported by the AI is [placeholder], which can be found in the maps/ folder.

Finally start the bot with python 3
$ python AI.py
or
$ python3 AI.py
if python3 is not the default.


If you want to start a human player
$ xpilot

Useful flags are
    -name "name"    To avoid duplicate names, in which case the server won't let you in.
Further options can be found with
$ man xpilot-ng-x11
