cd /path/to/where/you/want/your/code
git init
git remote add origin https://liuxpilot28@bitbucket.org/liuxpilot28/main.git
git pull -u origin master



add commit:
git commit -a -m "Describe changes" #locally
git push -u origin $branch #$branch is master if you haven't changed.

You can do several commits in a row before pushing if you want.


change branch:
git checkout $branch

create branch (branches from the branch you're currently in):
git branch $branch
git checkout $branch
git push -u origin $branch #don't need to do this until you want it out on the 'nets

delete branch:
git branch -d
#Think you need to push it as well, but unsure
